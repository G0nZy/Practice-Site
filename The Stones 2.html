                    This is a page dedicated to one of the greatest bands of all time,
                    thats right, the Stones.

                    <h2>Why I like the rolling stones</h2>

                    <p>
                        I really think the rolling stones are great because of what they did to the world of rock n roll music.
                        They revolutionized the world of rock n roll because they just had such dynamic music.
                        Now are they the best. No. Any band from the 60s couldve made the music the stones made. 
                        the same cannot be said for the beatles. the same cannot be said for bob dylan. 
                        but regardless of that fact. the stones were the ones who did do it. and for that we must give credit. 
                        are they the greatest most creative band of all time? no. but are they culture. yes. they made the culture my friend.
                        they arent a cornerstone. they arent the foundation. but they are a story. not just a brick. a story.

                                                In this section I want to talk about how the rolling stones really did revolutionize the rock landscape.
                                                They were the original rebels. they were the ones who did not give a single flying you know what about what 
                                                anyone said. They were the original rebels of the rock world. They embody what it means to be a rock star. 
                                                With Lead Singer Mick Jagger no party was ever boring.
